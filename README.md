Brief Description
This Laravel web application is a secure platform for managing organizations, transactions, and user accounts. It implements comprehensive security controls including input validation, authentication, authorization, XSS and CSRF prevention, database and file security, and additional security headers and measures, following OWASP and industry best practices.

Objective of the Enhancements
The objective of this website enhancement is to significantly improve its security by implementing comprehensive measures: input validation, authentication and authorization, XSS and CSRF prevention, database security, file security, and additional security measures to address potential vulnerabilities and enhance overall protection.

Web Application Security Enhancements
1. Vulnerability Report (OWASP ZAP)
Automated Scan: OWASP ZAP was run against the application.
Findings:
Cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite): ✔️ Set in Laravel config.
X-Powered-By header: ✔️ Removed in middleware.
CSP header: ✔️ Set in SecurityHeaders middleware.
Mixed content or self-signed SSL: ⚠️ May show on localhost, not in production.
Risk/Confidence:
No high-risk vulnerabilities found after fixes.
All findings are low/medium risk with high confidence if not fixed.

2. Input Validation
Client-side:

HTML5 validation (required, type, minlength, maxlength, pattern) in forms.
Server-side:

Laravel $request->validate() for all forms.
Example from TransactionController.php:

**resources/controllers/TransactionController.php**
```php
$request->validate([
    'donator_id' => 'required|exists:donators,id',
    'amount' => 'required|numeric|min:0',
    'remarks' => 'nullable|string|max:255',
    'receipt' => 'nullable|file|mimes:jpg,jpeg,png,pdf|max:2048',
]);
```

Technique:
Whitelist validation for type, length, format, and content.
Parameterized queries via Eloquent ORM.
3. Authentication
Password Storage:
Laravel uses bcrypt (strong, salted, one-way hashing).
Password Policies:
Enforced via validation rules (min length, complexity recommended).
Session Management:
Session IDs are strong, regenerated on login, invalidated on logout.
Cookies are HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite.
Multi-Factor Authentication:
TOTP 2FA enabled via Laravel Fortify.
Can be enforced for admins/high-privilege users.
Example:

4. Authorization
Vertical (Role-Based):
The application uses a custom middleware called Checkpermission to enforce role-based access control.
This middleware checks the current user's roles (from the UserRole model) and verifies if the user has permission to access the requested route by checking the RolePermission model.
If the user does not have the required permission for the route, a 403 Forbidden response is returned, preventing unauthorized access to protected resources.
Middleware Example:

How it is applied:
The Checkpermission middleware is registered in Kernel.php and applied to routes or route groups that require role-based access control.
Example route usage:

Horizontal (User Data):
In addition to role checks, controllers verify that users can only access or modify their own data, ensuring user-specific data protection.
5. XSS Prevention
Blade Escaping (Default):
Never use {!! $var !!} for user data.
CSP header set in middleware.
6. CSRF Prevention
Blade Form Token:
Laravel automatically validates CSRF tokens on POST/PUT/DELETE requests.
7. Database Security Principles
Eloquent ORM (Prevents SQL Injection):
Prepared Statements (if using DB facade):
Database user has least privilege (should not have DROP/ALTER rights).
Use Laravel encrypted casts for sensitive fields if needed.
8. File Security Principles
File Upload Validation and Storage:
.htaccess for Directory Listing (if using Apache):
For sensitive files, use private disk and serve via controller.
Set storage and cache to 755 and owned by web server user.
Never use 777 permissions.
9. Additional Security Measures
HTTPS enforced in production:
\URL::forceScheme('https') in AppServiceProvider.
HSTS header set:
SecurityHeaders middleware.
Session timeout:
Users are logged out after inactivity.
Security headers:
CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS, remove X-Powered-By.
